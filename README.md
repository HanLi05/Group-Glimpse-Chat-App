# Group Glimpse

## Project Description
This app is a chat app that sends notifications randomly to all users, reminding them to update their friends on 
what they're doing! I used Firebase for the backend, and Flutter/Dart for the frontend. It uses Firebase 
Authentication for account registration and login, Firestore Database for data storage, and Firebase Messaging
for notifications. Some of its main features include account registration and login, a live-updated message 
dashboard, group creation and deletion, and the notification system that prompts users for a special message. For 
a brief demo of the app, click this link to see a video: https://youtu.be/HKsPSIeBMkM

## Credits
Revised snippets of code from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBBycL0EtBQ. It provided a baseline for 
user registration and login, as well as very basic single-user message sending capabilities.
